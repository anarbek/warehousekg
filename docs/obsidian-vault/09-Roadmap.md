# Roadmap

Planned features, milestones, and the prioritized backlog over time.

## Completed

- **Authorization rollout** ✅ — All controllers use resource-based policies with hybrid RBAC + PBAC.
  Tenant permission matrix with `CanRead`/`CanWrite`/`CanDelete` per role per resource. Admin UI at
  `/admin/permissions` and `/admin/users`. See [[04-Auth-Flow]].
- **Delete policy** ✅ — DELETE endpoints use dedicated `{resource}:delete` policies (separate from write).
  Frontend conditionally hides delete buttons via `PermissionsService`.
- **Scenario permissions** ✅ — `add-items-back-in-time` (with configurable `MaxBackdateDays`) and
  `stock-receipts-delete-completed` for business-logic gating beyond CRUD.
- **Transaction date** ✅ — Stock receipts have a `transactionDate` picker. Backdating is gated by
  `add-items-back-in-time` permission.
- **Error toast** ✅ — Centralized `ErrorToastService` shows actual backend error messages in popup
  notifications instead of generic inline text.
